# Workspaces
The first thing you will want to do before you write code is create an environnement for your project. This environnement is called *Workspace*. The Workspace is the root folder containing subfolders and files essential to run your project.
These files will be generated using the **catkin_init_workspace** command.

Let's get into it!
<br><br>

* Choose a directory for your workspace, let's use 'catkin_ws'
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```
This will create a **CMakeLists.txt** file in your **/src** folder.
<br><br>

* Then we will make the project
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
This will create two subfolders, **build** and **devel**. The **build** folder is none of our interest in most of the part. The **devel** folder contains a number of files and directories, the most interesting of which are the setup files. Running these configures your system to use this workspace, and the code thatâ€™s (going to be) contained inside it.
<br><br>

* Configure your machine to use this Workspace
```
source devel/setup.bash
```


That's it, you've got your workspace up and running!
